This is an introductory course in the design of software solutions to engineering problems using software capable of being programmed by the user. Students learn procedural approaches to designing small to medium-scale programs. After successfully completing this course, students understand the issues involved in moving from a general problem statement to a software solution. Students learn a variety of software design solution techniques. They develop skills in logic, algorithm design, and data structure design and debugging. They apply these skills to a variety of engineering, mathematical, and numerical method problem areas. The methods of assessing student learning in the course are homework assignments; weekly quizzes; in-class, project-type programming assignments; and exams.
