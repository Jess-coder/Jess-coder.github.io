Hi there! I'm Jiali (Jessie) Huang. I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management](https://wne.edu/engineering/departments/industrial-engineering-and-engineering-management/index.cfm), [Western New England University](https://wne.edu/). Before joining WNE I received my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from [Edward P.

My research interest includes human factors, neuroergonomics; human-machine interaction; human cognition; neuroimaging, and neural disorder.
