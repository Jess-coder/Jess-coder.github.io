Objective
Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we examined how credibility and reliability affected the way brain regions exert causal influence over each other—effective connectivity (EC)—in the context of trust in automation.
Background
Multiple brain regions of the central executive network (CEN) and default mode network (DMN) have been implicated in trust judgment. However, the neural correlates of trust judgment are still relatively unexplored in terms of the directed information flow between brain regions.
Method
Sixteen participants observed the performance of four computer algorithms, which differed in credibility and reliability, of the system monitoring subtask of the Air Force Multi-Attribute Task Battery (AF-MATB). Using six brain regions of the CEN and DMN commonly identified to be activated in human trust, a total of 30 (forward, backward, and lateral) connection models were developed. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) was used to quantify the connectivity strength among the brain regions.
Results
Relative to the high trust condition, low trust showed unique presence of specific connections, greater connectivity strengths from the prefrontal cortex, and greater network complexity. High trust condition showed no backward connections.
Conclusion
Results indicated that trust and distrust can be two distinctive neural processes in human–automation interaction—distrust being a more complex network than trust, possibly due to the increased cognitive load.
Application
The causal architecture of distributed brain regions inferred using DCM can help not only in the design of a balanced human–automation interface design but also in the proper use of automation in real-life situations.
